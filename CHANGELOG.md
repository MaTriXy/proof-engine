# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-26

### Added

- Embedded page snapshots in `empirical_facts` for offline-reproducible proofs
- Hybrid verification fallback chain: live fetch → snapshot → Wayback Machine
- Wayback Machine fallback (opt-in via `wayback_fallback=True`)
- PDF citation verification via pdfplumber/PyPDF2 (optional dependencies)
- `fetch_mode` field in citation results: live / snapshot / wayback
- Eval 4: snapshot-mode proof (Tokyo population)
- Snapshot instructions for sandboxed environments (ChatGPT, cloud containers)

### Changed

- Proof template `__main__` reads structured dict fields directly — no message
  string parsing, no `import re` needed
- Citation verification details in proof_audit.md now include fetch_mode
- Environment Requirements section expanded with fallback chain documentation

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added

- Two-document report output: `proof.md` (reader-facing) + `proof_audit.md` (verification details)
- FACT_REGISTRY dict as single source of truth for cross-document fact IDs
- JSON summary block (`=== PROOF SUMMARY (JSON) ===`) with normalized structured fields
- `parse_range_from_quote()` for extracting ranges like "1.0°C to 2.0°C" from citations
- Provenance labels on audit doc sections (proof.py output vs author analysis)
- Empirical consensus proof guidance in template
- Eval 3: multi-source climate claim testing partial verification and cross-document consistency
- Claude Cowork support

### Fixed

- `explain_calc()` now preserves parentheses for lower-precedence sub-expressions
- `verify_extraction()` uses digit-boundary matching to prevent "1.1" matching inside "11.1"
- Rule 6 validator regex widened to match multi-word source keys (source_ipcc, source_noaa)
- Script path resolution: proofs use `PROOF_ENGINE_ROOT` instead of fragile `os.path` relative hack
- Marketplace `source` field compatible with Cowork remote API (named subdirectory, not root)
- `verify_citation()` returns "partial" for fragment-only matches instead of claiming full verification
- `verify_extraction()` raises ValueError by default instead of silently continuing
- `parse_number_from_quote()` raises ValueError (not IndexError) for missing capture groups
- Empty facts payload rejected by CLI instead of reporting "All citations verified"
- Citation normalization handles aggressive normalization and defaults to "Unknown method"

### Changed

- Plugin moved to `proof-engine/` subdirectory for Cowork marketplace compatibility
- Proof template split imports into structural (always needed) vs claim-specific (adapt per proof)
- `validate_proof.py` checks for FACT_REGISTRY, JSON summary block, and verify_extraction usage
- Report output changed from 1 file to 3 files (proof.py, proof.md, proof_audit.md)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added

- Initial release
- 7 hardening rules that close specific LLM failure modes
- Bundled scripts: extract_values, smart_extract, verify_citations, computations, validate_proof
- Two-phase extraction for complex Unicode quotes
- 5-level verdict system (PROVED, PROVED with unverified citations, DISPROVED, PARTIALLY VERIFIED, UNDETERMINED)
- Cross-platform support: Claude Code, Cursor, Manus, Codex CLI
- Evaluation suite with test prompts
